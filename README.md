# UpgradePlex
Simple python script to update Plex running on Ubuntu to the latest version.


If you want plex pass versions then you'll need to enter your X-Plex-Token otherwise it will fall back to the latest public version.

I'm pretty new to Python, and scripting in general, so suggestions and improvements are welcome!
